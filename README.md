## Introduction

This repository contains code, training data, and experimental validation for a **regularized variational autoencoder (VAE)** model that performs automatic feature extraction for the multi-objective design of DNA-stabilized silver nanoclusters (AgN-DNAs). The repository accompanies the manuscript titled **"Multi-Objective Design of DNA-Stabilized Nanoclusters Using Variational Autoencoders With Automatic Feature Extraction"** (Sadeghi, Mastracco, et al., 2024), DOI [accepted manuscript - pending DOI].

The goal of this project is to design DNA templates that can tune the fluorescence properties of silver nanoclusters (AgN-DNAs) for applications such as deep tissue bioimaging.

Traditional approaches rely on manual feature engineering to design DNA sequences that produce desired properties in AgN-DNAs, which can be labor-intensive and limited to a single property. In contrast, this VAE-based model is generative, allowing for **automatic feature extraction** and **multi-objective design**, enabling the simultaneous optimization of multiple AgN-DNA properties, such as fluorescence color and brightness.

Key contributions:
- A generative model for multi-property design of AgN-DNAs.
- Efficient sampling of DNA sequences with desired fluorescence properties.
- Application of **Shapley analysis** to identify DNA motifs responsible for specific properties.
- Broad applicability to other biomolecular systems with sequence-dependent properties.

## Problem Formulation and Solution

### Problem
Design DNA sequences that "code for" silver nanoclusters (AgN-DNAs) with specific properties, such as near-infrared (NIR) emission for deep tissue imaging. The challenge is to enable multi-objective optimization of DNA sequences without manual feature engineering.

### Solution
We developed a **property-regularized VAE** to learn a structured latent space that captures the relationships between DNA sequences and AgN-DNA properties. The VAE model can generate new DNA sequences optimized for specific fluorescence properties, providing both forward and inverse mappings (from sequence to properties and vice versa).
